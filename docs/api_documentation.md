# API Documentation
All API calls go through the base URL `https://ecsutdevents.azurewebsites.net/`. For example, you can GET all events by visiting or using an HTTP GET request on `https://ecsutdevents.azurewebsites.net/api/events/all`.

!!! note
    All times are stored server-side in UTC. Convert them to your local time zone.

!!! note
    You must have proper cloud firestore authentication headers to perform POST, PUT, or DELETE requests. We do not currently have plans to allow organizations access to these headers, as it may introduce a security vulnerability.
